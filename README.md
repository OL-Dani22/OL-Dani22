- 👋 Hi, I’m Dani (OL-DanY) and my native language in sources is german.
- 👀 I’m interested in C, JAVA, C++ ...
- In C I was used to program in my study in the early 90s (TurboC, BorlandC e.g. on Schneider PC) for instance an OS for SCARA robots and some more..
- In Java I'm experienced by 10 years autodidactic studies in the inspiring IDE Eclipse since 2000 (with baby & family pause 😺 ) and wrote by myself the tools that I need & some games for / with family in my free time. And especially in java I'm interested because of driving programs on Windows AND Linux (my favorite OS also for family).
   That is more satisfying for me than reading some kind of books or watching TV long time.
   But I'm also interested in other things like making music and doing sports 3-4 times a week or in motorcycling and much more (I'm also not a really nerd to permanently spend hours infront of the monitor). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects
- 📫 How to reach me e.g. https://kirche.social/@dani
- My project you can see here: https://github.com/oldy-22 - with more time I will upload some more!!
- Thats it for now! :) Have peace, love & fun all together in this special times!

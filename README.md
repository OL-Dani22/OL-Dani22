- 👋 Hi, I’m Dani and my native language in the sources is german.
- 👀 I’m interested in C, JAVA, C++ ...
- In Java I'm experienced by 10 years autodidactic studies in Eclipse since 2000 (with baby & family pause :) ) and wrote by myself the tools that I need & some games for / with family ... in my free time in java especially for driving on Windows AND Linux (my favorite).
   That is more satisfying for me than reading some kinds of books or watching TV.
   But I'm also interested in other things like making music and doing sports 3-4 time a week or motorcycling and much more (not a really nerd to spend hours infront of the monitor). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- My project you can see here: https://github.com/OL-Dani22 - with more time I will upload some more!!
- Thats it for now! :) Have peace, love & fun all together in this special times!

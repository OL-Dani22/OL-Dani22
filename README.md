- 👋 Hi, I’m Dani (@daenke)
- 👀 I’m interested in C, JAVA, C++ ...
- In Java I'm experienced by 10 years autodidactic studium and have self written my tools that I need & some games ... in my free time.
   That is more satisfying for me than reading books or watching TV.
   But I'm also interested in other things like making music and do sports 3-4 time a week do motorcycling and much more (not a really nerd to spend hours infront of monitor). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- My project you can see here: https://github.com/daenke - with more time I will upload some more!!
- Thats for first! :)
